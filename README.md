# SeoulMetro

ì§€ì˜¥ì² , or hellmetro, is a major pain point for commuters in Seoul.
During rush hours, you're either squeezed by the crowd or forced to let several trains pass before you can board.

Now, what if you're a traveler visiting Seoul?
Do you really want to experience the K-hellmetro?

... probably better to avoid it ðŸ˜‚
So, for your convenience, I analyzed which subway lines, sections, and times you should avoid.

Eventually, Iâ€™d love to build an app for this service â€” but for now, Iâ€™m starting with data analysis!
